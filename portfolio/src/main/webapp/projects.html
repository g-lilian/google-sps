      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
          Inside and outside of school, I've worked on a bunch of projects 
          involving things like AI, game development and robotics.

      <h2>Clothesvolutional</h2>
      <p>
          Clothesvolutional is an AI project conceived for the Splash Awards 
          competition organised by Singapore Computer Society. It progressed to 
          the final round and eventually won a Special Award (Finance). 
          My team developed a prototype of an e-commerce platform which uses hand-drawn sketches to 
          search for similar clothing listings. This was done by using a Generative 
          Adversarial Network to convert the user's sketch input into a photo-realistic 
          image of their desired piece of clothing. The 
          image is then channeled to a reverse image search engine, which returns 
          similar results found online.

      <h2>Memory Lanes</h2>
      <p>
          Memory Lanes is a puzzle and strategy game built with the Unity 3D 
          engine. It won First Place in the Gamecraft Hackathon 2019 organised 
          by NUS Game Development Group. The game revolves around the theme 
          "save", and the core mechanic involves saving and restoring the game 
          state at strategic moments to pass checkpoints on the level. 
          During the hackathon, I worked with a team of 4 others to build a 
          fully playable game with 9 different levels and custom assets.

      <h2>RTOS Project - Ivar</h2>
      <p>
          Ivar is a robotic vehicle equipped with flashing LEDs and a music 
          player, and can be operated using a mobile app. As part of a module on 
          real-time operating systems, my project mate and I designed the OS 
          and all functionalities, and implemented it on the ARM Cortex M0+ 
          microcontroller. We also had to solder components and connect the 
          hardware parts ourselves while trying not to fry the board.
