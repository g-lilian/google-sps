      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
          Inside and outside of school, I've worked on a bunch of projects 
          involving things like AI, game development and robotics.

          <h2>Clothesvolutional</h2>
          <p>
            Clothesvolutional is an AI project conceived for the Splash Awards 
            competition organised by Singapore Computer Society. It progressed to 
            the final round and eventually won a Special Award (Finance). 
            My team developed a prototype of an e-commerce platform which uses hand-drawn sketches to 
            search for similar clothing listings. This was done by using a Generative 
            Adversarial Network (GAN) to convert the user's sketch input into a photo-realistic 
            image of their desired piece of clothing. The 
            image is then channeled to a reverse image search engine, which returns 
            similar results found online.

          <h2>Memory Lanes</h2>
          <p>
            Memory Lanes is a puzzle and strategy game built with the Unity 3D 
            engine. It won First Place in the Gamecraft Hackathon 2019 organised 
            by NUS Game Development Group. The game revolves around the theme 
            "save", and the core mechanic involves saving and restoring the game 
            state at strategic moments to pass checkpoints on the level. 
            During the hackathon, I worked with a team of 4 others to build a 
            fully playable game with 9 different levels and custom assets.

          <h2>FPGA Programming - Whack a Mole</h2>
          <p>
            As part of a module on Digital Design, I implemented a sound volume 
            display and Whack a Mole game using the Basys 3 board, a microphone, 
            and an OLED screen. The mic detects whacking sounds, and the 
            player's score is registered on the 7 segments screen built into the 
            board. The entire project is <a href="https://github.com/g-lilian/project_mole">coded in Verilog</a>.

          <h2>RTOS Project - Ivar</h2>
          <p>
            Ivar is a robotic vehicle equipped with flashing LEDs and a music 
            player, and can be operated using a mobile app. As part of a module on 
            real-time operating systems, my project mate and I designed the OS 
            and all functionalities, and implemented it on the ARM Cortex M0+ 
            microcontroller. We also had to solder components and connect the 
            hardware parts ourselves while trying not to fry the board.
